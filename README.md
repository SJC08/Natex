## NatexMatcher

In essence, most of the matching and other work is performed by `INatexMatcher`.

The library already implements Matchers such as `VariableMatcher`, `StringMatcher`, `ComparisonMatcher`, `RangeMatcher`, `RegexMatcher`, `PropertyMatcher`, `MultiPatternMatcher`, and so on.

| NatexMatcher        | Pattern (example)   | Remark                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ComparisonMatcher   | `<0` `>=0` `â‰¥0`     | Compare IComparable.           |
| MultiPatternMatcher | `>1 <2`             | Split into multiple Natex.     |
| PropertyMatcher     | `Length:1`          | Match property of an object.   |
| RangeMatcher        | `1-100`             | Limit the range of IComparable |
| RegexMatcher        | `[0-9]`             | Use Regex.                     |
| StringMatcher       | `2024/1/1 00:00:00` | Call the ToString method.      |
| VariableMatcher     | `<Today>`           | Replace variables.             |

You can also create your **own** Matcher. You can get started quickly with the `NatexMatcher`, `NatexMatcher<TValue>`, `NatexMatcher<TValue, TData>` **class**, or the `INatexMatcher` **interface**.
